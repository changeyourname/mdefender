Excuse the level of informality in this document.

I assume you already know what M-Defender is .....

Mthwakazi Defender is a proudly Zimbabwean open source antimalware detection and removal tool 
programmed and maintaned by a group of developers from Bulawayo.

It was conceived in February 2014 as a fun project to make by its founders , Trevor Sibanda and Clifford J Mthemba.
It grew into an obsession and hard work went into making this engine easy to use and coded
in the most standard way possible.

For more info about the authors and changes. View the files AUTHORS.txt and CHANGELOG.txt in the program directory.
