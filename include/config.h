"The development cycle of future releases of M-Defender. \n\nThis Version of Mthwakazi Defender was built using 2 ancient computers, A old worn out Pentium 3 and an aging laptop (more like a desktop). \nA cloud scanner and mobile scanner versions have been affected by the lack of funds to get us a proper web hosting plan. \nAll the progress so far ( hundreds of hours coding, downloading malware samples, analysing malware sample, debugging) in the development of M-Defender have being out of the pockets of "\
" the developers, One of which is a under-grad(Cliff) and the other fresh out of high school (Trevor). \n\nTo help the project grow. You can donate to the Mthwakazi Developers Team using Eco-Cash OR contact us by email to setup an arrangement\n\nDonate To: 0783 102 754. <mthwakazidefender@gmail.com>\n";
