Greetings fellow noobz...

In this document I will be helping you build MDefender

All you need to do is install Codeblocks or Dev-C++ and AutoIT3 to get started

ONce installed you will find a folder called Components inside of which several
folders containing seperate components will be found there.

In each folder there should be a Dev-C++ project which once opened whould provide a ready build of that component.

The Dev-C++ project can also be imported into Code::Blocks using the imprt option of
Codeblocks.

All include files are in a folder named..... yes good boy, called include.. wonderful
And all source files are in a folder called .... source.

When you build a binary it is created in a folder name Release

If you have linking problems, just add all libraries in the lib folder.

Oh yeah by the way, the resources are found in a folder called res

The source code is commented... say thank you Trevor. 

I have never built this using MSVc++ so good luck with that (funny facial expression)


I use Linux, so don't  give me MSVc++ problems OK... thank you :) ( WINE dear foo... WINE)

Guys remember this is an antimalware engine... I cant start teaching people what a variable is.


Thank you.
